# Final-Assignment
My Last Project

PLZ READ THE FINALPROJECT.html thats not in the folders, just the one you see first. That is up to date version.

Here is what I have for my final assignment so far!

I am using this as informational page about my music blog "Blend & Snap". I wnated to create something that unique to me and something that showcased my work. So first you see the Logo I made on photoshop at the top, then we have a description of "Blend & Snap", our current library of mixes, our IWD 2019 SoundCloud playlist, our Spotify playlist, and beneath that will be my API that will hopefully return the names of "Megan thee Stallions" albums who is our "artist of the month", below that is a button cause I thought it was funny. Then I have my email link and other stuff at the bottom. MY api call is still giving me a hard time but I am workng on it now. 

Hope this looks ok!
