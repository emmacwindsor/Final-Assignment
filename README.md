# Final-Assignment
My Last Project


I am using this as informational page about my music blog "Blend & Snap". I wanted to create something that was unique to me and something that showcased my work. So first you see the Logo I made on photoshop at the top, then we have a description of "Blend & Snap", our current library of mixes, our IWD 2019 SoundCloud playlist, our Spotify playlist, and beneath that is the Spotify API call that features Beyonce's albums who is our "artist of the month", below that is a button cause I thought it was funny. Then I have my email link and other stuff at the bottom. 

Hope this looks ok!
