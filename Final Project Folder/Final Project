<h1>EMMA's Page</h1>
  <body>
  This is my HTML webpage for Week 6.
  I am creating this page as part of an assignment.
  It has been rather hard to get down how to work this all out, but I think I am getting it down!
  Computer Programming is actually the last class I am taking before I graduate, so it's crazy to think that
  I am almost done. I am now going to include a paragraph taken from my career distiction statement.
  My name is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/emma.windsor">Emma Windsor</a>, and I am a young music business professional.
  My passion and hard work is what drives my career and what allows me to be so successful in all my positions within the music industry.
  Over the years, I have worked throughout music management, promotion, marketing, hospitality, and production providing a professional, positive, and dedicated work ethic always.
  My eagerness to learn more, creative nature, and ability to adapt makes me a great addition to any team, and I hope to share that with you.
